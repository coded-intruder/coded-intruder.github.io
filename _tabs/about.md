## About CodedIntrusion
Codedintrusion is a technical research log focused on practical experiments in offensive security and adversarial tradecraft.

Each post is built around real experiments, controlled enviroments, and observable behaviour. The goal is to develop a deep technical understanding of how attacks actually work, how they evade assumptions, and where defensive models break down

This is an independent research project and a long-term learning record.
## About the Author

I'm an independent security researcher focused on hands-on experimentation and offensive tradecrafts. I document researches at codedintrusion.com, where i explore how assumptions fails across modern systems.

My goal is to build a strong technical foundation through experiments, documentation, and continous learning.
